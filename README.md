# Project Management System

## Description
This programme is designed for a small structural engineering firm. It enables you to add details of each project you are working on.
Each project is assigned a number and then prompts the user to add details of the project, such as the type of building, the address of the project.
The user can also add details of the architect and contractor working on the project as well as the customer's details.

## Uses
* Store information regarding a large number of projects 
* Make changes to the project (such as amount paid or a change in deadline)
* Easily update changes to personal data (of the architect or customer)
